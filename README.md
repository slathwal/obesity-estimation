# Overview
We have access to a dataset of 2111 individuals that records their obesity Level along with 17 attributes related with eating habits, physical condition, and demographics.

## Business Objective
World Health Organization is interested in understanding key features associated with obsesity levels in three different locations - Mexico, Peru and Colombia. Using the provied dataset, we want to understand the main factors that contribute to obesity levels. Once the top factors are identified, WHO can make a decision about focusing educational initiatives and allocating financial resources towards the identified factors in order to achieve the most improvement in health outcomes.

Therefore, the key deliverable for us is the list of top 3 factors that are most strongly correlated with obesity levels.
