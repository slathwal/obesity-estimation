# Introduction
We are working on estimating obesity levels from lifestyle and demographic factors.

## Business Objective
With our analysis, we want to understand the key demographic and lifestyle factors that contribute to obesity levels in Mexico, Peru and Colombia so that we can target efforts (training, budget) in areas that are likely to achieve the most improvement in health outcomes.
